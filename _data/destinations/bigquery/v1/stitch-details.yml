      To improve your query performance, you can apply partitioning and/or clustering to Stitch-created tables in your {{ destination.display_name }} destination. Your settings will remain intact even when new data is loaded.

      Refer to the [Table partitioning and clustering guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.bigquery-partitioning | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for application instructions.
