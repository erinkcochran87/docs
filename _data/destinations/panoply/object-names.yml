      This means that {{ destination.display_name }} destinations treat upper- and lowercase characters as the same. For example: `CUSTOMERID` and `customerid` are equal in {{ destination.display_name }}.

      When column names are loaded into {{ destination.display_name }}, any uppercase characters will be forced into lowercase. This means that `Id` and `id` will canonicalize to the same name, which can lead to object collision errors. Refer to the [Column naming section of this guide](#column-naming) for examples.
