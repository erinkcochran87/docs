# Code of Conduct

Here at Stitch we strive to inspire, empower, and help data-driven people take back control and ownership of their data. That means creating and maintaining a welcoming, productive, and diverse community where everyone's ideas and contributions are appreciated and respected.

Whether you're submitting your own contribution, commenting on someone else's work, or participating in a Stitch Docs discussion, everyone in the community is expected to abide by this Code of Conduct.

We strongly believe in the concept of **DTRT**, or **Doing The Right Thing**. We use this phrase to remind ourselves to make decisions that we'll be proud of in the long term. For this community, that means:

## Be considerate

Your work will be used by other people and in turn you'll depend on the work of others.

**Do The Right Thing (DTRT)**: When making a decision, consider other community members and Stitch users who may be affected.

## Be respectful

While you may not always agree with others, disagreements and frustration should never turn into personal attacks. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. All members of the community, whether they have contributed to the Stitch Docs or not, are to be treated with respect.

**DTRT**: If conflict arises, work to resolve it with empathy and humility.

## Take responsibility for our words and our actions

Everyone makes mistakes. It's okay.

**DTRT**: If someone has been harmed or offended, listen carefully and respectfully and work to right the wrong.

## Be collaborative

Excellent documentation requires collaboration. The developer who builds an app will have a different perspective on it than the technical writer who documents it, and the customer who uses the app will have a different perspective than them both.

In short: Collaboration makes for excellent documentation.

**DTRT**: When making contributions, communicate, work transparently, and involve others.

## Ask for help

The entire purpose of documentation is to teach, guide, and answer questions. To that end, you should feel comfortable asking questions if you're not sure about something. Asking questions early can help avoid problems and confusion later.

**DTRT**: If you're not sure about something, ask for help.

## Step down considerately

Contributors will come and go, just as they do with every project.

**DTRT**: If you decide to step down, let us know and help us ensure someone can pick up where you left off.
