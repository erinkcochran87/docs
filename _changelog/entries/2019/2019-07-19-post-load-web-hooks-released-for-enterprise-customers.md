We’ve released a feature that will send a webhook to a configurable address after each time data is loaded into your data warehouse. This new feature enables customers to prompt other systems and processes to act on the data loaded by Stitch. It’s available for our Enterprise customers, and you can try it out during a 14-day free trial. Learn more in our [docs]({{ link.account.post-load-notifications | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
